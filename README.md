# CitiBike-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis of CitiBike trip data using Python, Pandas, and Folium.

# 🚴 CitiBike Data Analytics: Python & SQL Integration

This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline: from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to **Relational Database Management** using SQL Server (SSMS). 

The analysis is based on the Jersey City CitiBike dataset (December 2025), focusing on user trends and station popularity.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

### **Data Science (Python)**
* **Library Proficiency:** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium.
* **Cleaning:** Handling missing station data and optimizing data types.
* **Geospatial Mapping:** Created interactive HeatMaps to visualize high-traffic ride zones.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated ride durations and extracted time-based insights.

### **Database Management (SQL)**
* **Schema Design:** Creating structured tables with appropriate Data Types and Primary Keys.
* **Advanced Querying:** Proficient use of `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` for business reporting.
* **Complex Filtering:** Using `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, and `IN` operators for granular data analysis.
* **Performance:** Writing optimized queries to handle 48,000+ rows of trip data.

## 📊 Key Project Insights
1. **Rider Split:** ~80% of users are Annual Members, while ~20% are Casual riders.
2. **Busy Hubs:** Grove St PATH is the most frequent start and end point.
3. **Trip Duration:** Casual riders typically have longer trip durations compared to members.
